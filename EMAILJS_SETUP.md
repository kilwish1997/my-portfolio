## Step 1: Create EmailJS Account

2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. Follow the authentication steps
5. Note down your **Service ID** (you'll need this later)

## Step 3: Create Email Template

1. Go to "Email Templates" in your dashboard
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Design your email template with these variables:
   ```
   From: {{from_name}} ({{from_email}})
   To: {{to_name}}
   Subject: New Contact Form Message from {{from_name}}
   
   Message:
   {{message}}
   ```
4. Save the template and note down your **Template ID**

## Step 4: Get Your Public Key

1. Go to "Account" â†’ "API Keys"
2. Copy your **Public Key**

## Step 5: Update Configuration

1. Open `src/emailjs-config.js`
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:
   ```javascript
   export const EMAILJS_CONFIG = {
     SERVICE_ID: 'your_actual_service_id',
     TEMPLATE_ID: 'your_actual_template_id', 
     PUBLIC_KEY: 'your_actual_public_key',
   };
   ```

## Step 6: Test Your Form

1. Start your development server: `npm start`
2. Go to the contact section
3. Fill out the form and submit
4. Check your email to see if the message was received
5. Check the browser console for any error messages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Service not found" error**: Double-check your Service ID
2. **"Template not found" error**: Double-check your Template ID  
3. **"Invalid public key" error**: Double-check your Public Key
4. **Form not submitting**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Security Notes:

- The Public Key is safe to expose in client-side code
- Never share your Private Key (if you have one)
- Consider rate limiting on your form to prevent spam
